This is event website, where seamless user experience meets cutting-edge functionality! Our platform boasts an array of impressive features, including user-friendly login/signup, a captivating home page, personalized user profiles, and a convenient feedback system. What sets us apart is our innovative approach â€“ all screens execpet the home page, such as booking, payment, and confirmation pages, elegantly appear as pop-ups, ensuring a sleek and unintrusive design. We've embraced this unique solution as a creative workaround, staying true to our commitment even when restricted from using frameworks.

While implementing it:
Benjamin Ishimwe: He worked on the profile page, the payment page,  the feedback page, the booking page, the payment page and the booking confirmation page.
Erica Nshimirimana: She worked on the home page, the login and signUp pages and she wrote the overview and the problem solving process and she did the assignment submission process.
